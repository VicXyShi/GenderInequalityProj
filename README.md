# "Professional Project Leader"
### An employee training game aiming at raising people's awareness of gender biases within workplace

# Introduction

## Motivations

Due to confirmation bias, individuals often overlook their own gender biases, making it crucial to raise awareness, especially among management. However, most gender equality lessons within organizations are perceived as tedious lectures, lacking engagement from workers and managers. **WE WILL CHANGE THIS.**  Through our gaming system and NLP, we aim to help individuals identify any latent gender discrimination beliefs. Our interactive gaming approach transforms these lessons into engaging storytelling experiences. This shift in approach encourages active participation and understanding among workers and managers.

## What it does

The game serves to enhance players' comprehension of gender equity. Unlike traditional surveys where participants often self-report no gender bias, our game functions akin to a "double-blind experiment." It evaluates players' genuine subconscious attitudes towards gender. Through interactive gameplay, participants gain insights into workplace gender discrimination, fostering awareness and understanding.

## How we built it

We mainly developed the program in Python with Pygame library. With Decision Tree and Natural Language Process, we tried to make the game as a simulation of real-life scenarios where discrimination over gender could happen. 

### We first developed our idea.

Even in the 21st century, gender discrimination still exists, particularly in the Tech field. Yet people might be tired of this old topic and might not be interested in being preached on that. Thus, aiming to provide a real feeling on the current-day discrimination in workplace, we developed a program providing a manager role for the user to decide what employee he or she wants to use. Then, we will provide a perspective from the employee, interacting with the user’s own decision and thus could cause users to ruminate on their daily lives and small thought directed to discrimination. 

### Then we designed the game flow

After deciding what the game will be about and what tech stack we would like to use—Pygame, we started making the vague idea more and more concrete and split them into different steps. We had UI designers, story writers, data scientists, and software development engineers. We all provided different perspectives regarding the implementation, art, efficiency, etc. 

### Split the work and get hands dirty

After several rounds of brainstorming, we started to split the task among every teammate, drawing, programming, data training, etc. We decided to make the game look more like a leadership game instead of a didactic program. 

## Challenges we ran into

Importing the machine learning model from JupyterNoteBook (.ipynb) to a Python file (.py) took us quite some time to figure out the exact way. Moreover, all of us are first-time hackers and have very limited experience in game design, so learning how to use Pygame to design a game was also a main challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

As a team of first-time hackers, we managed to build a game that is able to identify potential gender bias deeply entrenched within each individual. We’re both proud of our idea (the ambition of raising awareness of potential gender bias in the workplace) and our efforts to start from scratch and learn along the way.

## What we learned

Technically speaking, we’ve learned how to use Python (Pygame specifically) to develop an interactive game. We’ve also improved our knowledge in areas such as machine learning. UIDesign has also been a key to our project. 

What’s more meaningful is what we’ve learned through our planning of the game. It was a lesson for us to always keep in mind that potential gender biases may exist around us or even in our minds.

## What's next for "ProfessionalProjectLeader"-Raising Awareness of Gender Bias

Add more decision-making plots and situations for the player. After the player saw their scores, show them workers’ perspectives to let them better realize the impact of their behavior and gender discrimination idea on others. Add a time record function in the game, to better measure whether the player has gender discrimination or not. If the player hesitates for a long time during making decisions, then it is highly likely that he/she is trying to hide his/her true thoughts,
